- We included all relevant results and numbers within the main body of the report in such a way that the tables and figures from the appendix are only needed if the reader wants to look for further detail.
- We made and overall revision and adjustment of the clarity of the writing were we felt it could be improved, including the specific suggestions from the comments.
